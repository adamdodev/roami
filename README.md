# Roami

**Roami** is the ultimate travel inspriation assitant. This smart little buddy can grab trip ideas from social media posts, websites, magazine articles, even voice notes! They'll then tag and save your new bucket-list item and help you plan the ultimate getaway ðŸ§³ðŸ›«

This repo is for developers interested in the Roami source code and contributing fixes and features. For general info about Roami and how to get the app, check out the Roami website (coming soon).

## Background and Goals

Roami was started by [Adam Westbrook](https://www.github.com/adamdodev) in 2025. The goal was to not only create a convenient, automated day-to-day app for collecting travel inspiration, but also to create a real-world use case to discuss the following:

- Assess the state of on-device AI capabilities in modern smartphones.
- Assess and promote [local-first development](https://localfirstweb.dev/) practices.
- User fatigue with subscription-based revenue services.
